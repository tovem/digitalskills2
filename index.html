     <h1>The First Women's Himalayan Expedition</h1>
     <hr>
     <p>
       <font face="perpetua" size="5" color="#1c87c9">In the Spring of 1955, three seemingly ordinary women, set off with the ambition of climbing in the last large unexplored area of the Himalaya. Unbeknownst to Monica Jackson, Elizabeth Stark and Evelyn Camrass, this trip was to be an expedition of firsts, a historically significant moment for both Scottish and Women’s mountaineering.</font></p>

     <h2>Blazing the Trail</h2>
     <p>
       <font face="perpetua" size="3" color="#1c87c9">Since its completion, the expedition has been regarded as a historically significant mountaineering moment, pioneering in nature. The climbers pushed both physical and social frontiers, challenging and changing attitudes towards women in mountaineering.</font></p>
     <p>
       <font face="perpetua" size="3" color="#1c87c9">This Himalayan expedition was also historical in terms of mountaineering for it contributed to the large blank spaces on the maps of the Himalaya. To fully appreciate the significance of the expedition, it is important to gain some context into mountaineering in the Himalaya at that time. It was only in 1950 that Nepal permitted foreign entry into the country. During this year, Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal reached the summit of Annapurna, making it the first eight-thousand-meter peak ever successfully climbed. Three years later was Edmund Hillary’s historical ascent of Mount Everest in 1953. So, just two years later when the party set off to the last large unexplored area of the Himalaya, the women were at the forefront of modern mountaineering in the Himalayas. </font></p>
     <p>
       <font face="verdana" size="3" color="#1c87c9">With inaccurate and often blank maps, the trio dived into the world of unknowns. Evelyn describes the challenges they faced:</font>
     <span class="soundcite" data-id="1010806465" data-start="1088000" data-end="1099567" data-plays="1"><font face="verdana" size="4" color="#1c87c9"><i>“We had no idea whether; 1, whether the Sherpas would work for us; 2, whether we would ever reach the mountains; 3, if we would find our way into the mountains; and 4, if we would find a mountain we could climb”.</i></font></span></p>
     <p>
       <font face="verdana" size="3" color="#1c87c9">As a result, the contributions the expedition made to the understanding of the Jugal Himal was paramount. By filling the blank spaces and disproving the inaccuracies in the map, the expedition proved to be a catalyst for numerous further explorations in the area.</font></p>
     <p>
       <font face="verdana" size="3" color="#1c87c9">It wasn’t until months into the planning and preparation that the climbers became aware that this was to be an expedition of firsts, they had not predicted that they would be setting any kind of precedence. This expedition was to be the first all-women led expedition to the Himalaya. The climbers were fairly delighted to discover this fact for the sole reason that it could increase their chances to secure necessary financial sponsorship. However, they were not without instances of prejudice.</font></p>
     <p>
       <font face="verdana" size="3" color="#1c87c9">When applying for climbing permits for the Himalaya and permission from the British Alpine Committee, the women were hampered by stereotypes of feminine weakness. Concerns were voiced over how the women would cooperate with the local men, for example how would they deal with drunken Sherpas? It was clear that regardless of the level of climbing ability, the absence of any western men in this expedition was held against the party, for fear of them being helpless.</font></p>
     <p>
       <font face="verdana" size="3" color="#1c87c9">Additionally, there was a feeling that society was fairly pessimistic about the prospect of the expedition. As if it was inevitable that something would happen to make people question why the women were ‘allowed’ to go mountaineering alone. Monica writes,<i>“Whereas a disaster in an all-male or mixed party may have passed almost unremarked… the world was waiting to say “I told you so. What else can you expect of women?””</i>.  Despite the misogynistic apprehension and multiple assertions in the Indian Press that the climbers would be wearing makeup and lipstick during the expedition, the climbers were actually able to free themselves from cynical societal misapprehensions. The climbers set off into the Himalayas to climb in the last large unexplored area of the Himalaya and returned back having done just that, unscathed despite their gender. The success of the expedition proved that ordinary women were just as capable of carrying out such a feat as men. Ideas around what the ideal climber should look like dissolved as mountaineering was no longer just a man’s endeavour. In the subsequent years after the expedition, multiple all-female parties embarked on trips to the Himalaya, inspired by the efforts of Evelyn, Betty and Monica.</font></p>
